# All services (localstack-init, polaris-init) use this configuration.
#
# Bucket purposes:
# - warehouse: Primary data warehouse storage (Iceberg tables)
# - iceberg: Additional Iceberg table storage
# - dbt-artifacts: dbt build artifacts storage
# - floe-cube-preaggs: Cube Store pre-aggregation storage (external pre-aggs)
