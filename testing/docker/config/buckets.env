# This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for bucket names.
# All services (localstack-init, polaris-init) use this configuration.

# Bucket purposes:
# - warehouse: Primary data warehouse storage (Iceberg tables)
# - iceberg: Additional Iceberg table storage
# - cube-preaggs: Cube pre-aggregation cache
# - dbt-artifacts: dbt build artifacts storage

# Comma-separated list of buckets to create on LocalStack startup
