# S3 Bucket Configuration for floe-runtime Testing Infrastructure
# ================================================================
# This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for bucket names.
# All services (localstack-init, polaris-init) use this configuration.
#
# Bucket purposes:
# - warehouse: Primary data warehouse storage (Iceberg tables)
# - iceberg: Additional Iceberg table storage
# - dbt-artifacts: dbt build artifacts storage
#
# Note: Cube pre-aggregations use source database storage (external: false) in testing.
# For production with Cube Store, configure S3 bucket via Helm values.

# Comma-separated list of buckets to create on LocalStack startup
